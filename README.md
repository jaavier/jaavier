### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm originally from Santiago, Chile, but I've been calling Paris, France, home for some time now. My journey into the programming world started at the age of 10, and since then, I've been constantly learning and exploring new technologies. Iâ€™m passionate about building solutions that push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.

Hereâ€™s a quick look at my technical expertise:

- **Backend Development**: *Go, Python, Node.js (+TypeScript)*
- **Python Libraries**: *Flask, Selenium, Qt4, Boto3*
- **Frontend Development**: *React.js, TailwindCSS*
- **Databases**: *MySQL, PostgreSQL (Relational) | MongoDB, DynamoDB (NoSQL)*
- **Blockchain**: *Web3, Metamask, Solidity, Bitcoin*
- **Mobile Development**: *React Native with Expo.io*
- **Cloud & Infrastructure**: *AWS (Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB, IAM, API Gateway, SES, SNS)*

Iâ€™m always open to new challenges and love collaborating on projects that allow me to grow and innovate. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect!
